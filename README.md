## Updating content

- Edit the relevant `.html` file directly.
- To add/replace a photo, drop the source image into its original folder, then generate a web-sized copy into `assets/img/` (e.g. with `sips -Z 1600 source.jpg --out assets/img/name.jpg` on macOS) and reference it from `photos.html`.
- To update the resume, replace `Resume/SuneethaMekala_Resume.pdf` and copy it to `assets/resume/SuneethaMekala_Resume.pdf`.
